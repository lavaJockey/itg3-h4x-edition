What it would have looked like if ITG3 officially was released and was modded by the community.
Based on the [H4X Theme](http://concubidated.com/stepmania/index.php?dir=Themes/3.95/&file=ITG%20H4X%20Edition.zip)
As well as [itg3theme](https://github.com/openitg/itg3theme)

Setup:
1. Clone or Download!
2. Extract the .zip or contents of itg3-h4x-edition into the root of OpenITG!
3. Then change the theme through OpenITG!
4. Done!
(NotITG is usable but will affect some animations and ruin some things!!!)

What is the Nostalgia noteskin:
The Nostalgia noteskin is the base of the default/note noteskin from SM3.9
But with default ITG note colors and note explosion colors.
